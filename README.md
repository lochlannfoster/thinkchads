# Thinkchads

## What's this?
This is just a repository for me to back up my neon-green 'haxxor-theme' i3wm rice and config for my **Thinkchads** laptop.
It will likely never be complete but I'd like to keep improving it over time.

## Highlights
- neon-green oldschool haxxor aesthetic
- matching dmenu aesthetic
- custom i3blocks widgets with pretty colours for visibility
- custom motd in bash terminals
- mostly default i3 hotkeys for accessibility purposes I don't want to have to learn new hotkeys

## WIP / to-do
- setup script, not sure best way to implement, currently you gotta symlink everything manually
- i3lock rice
- some vim rice would be cool
- needs file manager rice
- i3status tray icons in similar aesthetic
- maybe try figure out how to silence ssh-add to maintain motd aesthetic
- idk make the whole thing gooder overall
